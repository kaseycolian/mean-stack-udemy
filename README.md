# MeanCourseApp

Created with instruction by Udemy Course: [Angular & NodeJs - The MEAN Stack Guide](https://www.udemy.com/angular-2-and-nodejs-the-practical-guide/).

This project was generated with [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) version 6.5.0, [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.2, and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 10.15.1 LTS.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Express server

Run `npm run start:server` to start express server for the backend.  Database is IP protected and IPs need to be whitelisted.  To create a MongoDB cluster to use for this project, create a new cluster and replace URL in mongoose.connect() in app.js.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
